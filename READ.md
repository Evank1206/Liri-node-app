---Issue one ----
when search and click them each time for example the band info multifys and messy layout 

the reason:
semantic.ui for styling which is class="ui container" etc...
When creating dynamic elements & tags in javascript shouldn't use styling class names, prefer to give id for each element or tag that creating & using them.
